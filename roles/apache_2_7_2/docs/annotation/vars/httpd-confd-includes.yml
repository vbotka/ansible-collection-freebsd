task_httpd-confd-includes_synopsis: |2
  Configure sections using the filter encode_apache.

task_httpd-confd-includes_description: |2
  Take the YAML configuration files from the directory ``apache_confd_dir_sections`` (7) at master
  and create the configuration files (24) at the remote host. The created configuration files are
  included in the configuration file ``httpd.conf`` by default. For example,

  .. code-block:: yaml

    shell> grep Includes /usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf
    Include etc/apache24/Includes/*.conf

  **Include data from conf.d (2-19)**

  Include tasks from the file ``al_include_confd_vars_list`` (13) in the role ``vbotka.ansible_lib``
  (12). This task takes as parameters the directory of the YAML configuration files (7) and the
  type of the list (8), and returns the list with the YAML configurations of the sections stored in
  the variable ``al_include_confd_vars_list``. The parameters (7, 8) are tested inside the included
  tasks.

  **Configure sections in Includes directory (21-30)**

  Use the filter ``encode_apache`` to create the configuration files (24) for the sections. See the
  template ``section2.j2``.
