  OS specific default variables will be loaded from the files in the directories `vars

  <https://github.com/vbotka/ansible-apache/blob/master/vars/defaults/>`_. OS specific custom

    - See :ref:`ug_variables`

task_vars_note:
  - Put OS specific variables here.
  - Because of the precedence (15.role vars), there are limited options to override these variables.

task_vars_hint:
  - It might be more convenient to maintain the variables incrementally.
  - See `al_include_os_vars_path_incr.yml
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbotka/ansible-lib/devel/tasks/al_include_os_vars_path_incr.yml>`_

task_vars_warning:
  - Put customized OS specific variables into the files in the dictionary *vars/*
  - Changes stored in the directory *vars/defaults* will be overwritten by an update of the role.
