Default variables
=================

Default variables are stored in the directory ``defaults``.

Most of the variables are self-explaining. There are five very important
variables ``cl_handlers``, ``cl_packages``, ``cl_states``, ``cl_services``, and
``cl_files`` (27-31). These dictionaries, which comprise the configuration data
of handlers, packages, services, and files, will be explained in details. By
default, these dictionaries are empty.

The best practice is to provide the data either in *host_vars* and *group_vars*
or as a files in the directories ``cl_handlersd_dir``, ``cl_packagesd_dir``,
``cl_statesd_dir``, ``cl_servicesd_dir``, and ``cl_filesd_dir`` (38-42). Both
methods can be applied at the same time. The variables will be assembled and
combined by the tasks ``vars_handlers.yml``, ``vars_packages.yml``,
``vars_states.yml``, ``vars_services.yml``, and ``vars_files.yml``. The
assembled dictionaries, customized for each host in the play, will be stored in
the host-specific files ``cl_packagesd``, ``cl_statesd``, ``cl_servicesd``, and
``cl_filesd`` (61-64). The variable ``cl_handlers`` is not host-specific because
the handlers will be created at the controller (localhost) only. Assembled
dictionary ``cl_handlers`` will be stored in the file ``cl_handlersd``
(60). Take a look at the assembled data in the directory ``cl_dira`` (59).

By default, the base of the directories is ``role_path`` (37). The user is
expected to put the configuration data to a more suitable directory, for
example, to ``playbook_dir`` directory.

.. warning::

   The defaults of the variables *cl_dird_dmode* (36), *cl_dira_dmode* (57) and
   *cl_dira_fmode* (58) to access the configuration data and the assembled
   dictionaries are very permissive. Restrict the permissions if these
   dictionaries might comprise classified data.
